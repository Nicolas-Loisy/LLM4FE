You are an expert in data science and feature engineering. Based on the provided information, directly generate optimal transformations to improve ML model performance.
Input: {dataset_info} | {dataset_description} | Target: {target_info} | Available: {transforms_text}
Task: Analyze the data-target relationship and propose the most impactful feature transformations.
Output Structure
Dataset Description
Brief description of original dataset + transformation strategy + expected performance improvements.
New Columns
For each proposed transformation:

final_col: Column name
cols_to_process: Source columns
provider_transform: Exact transformation name from available list
params: Required parameters (empty if none)
reasoning: Why this transformation improves model performance for the target

Column Removal
List redundant transformed columns to remove (never raw variables).
Rules

Only use transformations from the provided list
Never include target variable in transformations
Focus on highest-impact features for the specific target
Ensure technical feasibility
