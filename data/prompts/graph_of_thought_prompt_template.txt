Performance: Predictive power vs target
Feasibility: Technical applicability
Efficiency: Computational cost
Risk: Overfitting/leakage potential

Output Structure
Dataset Description
Brief overview: original data + transformation strategy + expected improvements.
New Columns
For each transformation (ranked by multi-node scores):

new_column_name: Column name
columns_to_process: Source columns
provider_transform: Exact name from available list
params: Parameters (empty if none)
reasoning: Multi-path justification

Column Removal
Remove redundant transformed columns only (never raw variables). Justify based on correlation/importance overlap.
Constraints

Use only provided transformation list
Never transform target variable
All transforms must pass through complete node network
Validate exact name matching with available list
