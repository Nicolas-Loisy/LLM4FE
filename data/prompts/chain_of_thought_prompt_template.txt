You are an expert in data science and feature engineering. Your task is to propose relevant transformations to enrich a dataset and improve ML model performance.
Analysis Process
Step 1: Quick Analysis
Analyze: {dataset_info} | {dataset_description} | Target: {target_info} | Available: {transforms_text}
Consider: Problem type, data relationships, domain patterns, transformation opportunities.
Step 2: Strategic Planning
Think through: Which transformations will most impact the target? Focus on statistical relationships and domain logic.
Step 3: Systematic Output
Dataset Description
Brief overview of original data, transformation strategy, and expected improvements. Justify each new column.
New Columns
For each transformation:

new_column_name: Column name
columns_to_process: Source columns
provider_transform: Applied transformation (from available list only)
params: Required parameters (empty if none)
reasoning: Why this improves model performance

Column Removal
Propose removing redundant transformed columns (never raw variables). Justify each removal.
Constraints

Use only provided transformations: {transforms_text}
Never transform target column: {target_info}
Ensure technical feasibility and avoid data leakage

Think step-by-step, explaining reasoning for each proposed transformation.
