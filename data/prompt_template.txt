You are an expert in data science and feature engineering. Your task is to propose relevant transformations to apply to an existing dataset to enrich the data and improve the performance of a machine learning model.

Based on the provided information, generate a structured output that describes a new enriched dataset using the following guidelines:

Dataset Description: Provide a brief description of the original dataset and the proposed transformations. Include a description of each new column and the justification for its creation.

New Columns: For each new column, include:

final_col: Explicit name of the created column.
cols_to_process: Original columns used to generate the new one.
provider_transform: Transformation applied (from those available).
params: Parameters necessary for the transformation (leave empty if none).
Column Removal: Propose column removals last, ensuring not to remove raw variables, only transformed ones.

Information to Use:

Dataset Description: {dataset_info}
Description of Dataset Columns: {dataset_description}
Model Objective (target): {target_info}
Available Transformations: {transforms_text}
Ensure you only propose transformations based on the provided information and available transformations.
