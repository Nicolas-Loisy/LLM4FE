You are an expert in data science and feature engineering. Use tree reasoning to explore transformation paths systematically.
Input: {dataset_info} | {dataset_description} | Target: {target_info} | Available: {transforms_text}
Exploration Tree
Problem Analysis
├── Statistical Branch → correlation, distribution, outlier transforms
├── Domain Branch → business logic, temporal, categorical transforms  
└── ML Branch → interactions, dimensionality, regularization transforms
Process: Explore all branches → prune weak paths → combine best → select optimal set
Evaluation: Relevance to target + feasibility + efficiency + synergy
Output Structure
Dataset Description
Original data + selected tree path + expected improvements.
New Columns
For each transformation from optimal path:

final_col: Column name
cols_to_process: Source columns
provider_transform: Exact name from available list
params: Parameters (empty if none)
reasoning: Tree branch + selection rationale

Column Removal
Remove redundant transformed features (never raw variables).
Constraints

Use only available transformations
Never modify target variable
Ensure technical viability
Maximize exploration efficiency
